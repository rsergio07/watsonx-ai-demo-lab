# Repository Challenge: Create and Submit Your Repository

## Objective
Apply the best practices for GitHub repositories by creating a well-structured and documented repository. Submit your repository URL for feedback and experience the process of receiving feedback via GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

---

## Task Requirements

### 1. Create a New Repository
- Use a clear and descriptive name that reflects the project’s purpose.
- Follow naming conventions (e.g., `sre-project-name` or `watsonx_model_trainer`).

### 2. Protect the Main Branch
- Enable branch protection rules:
  - Require pull request reviews before merging.
  - Enforce status checks (if applicable).
  - Restrict direct pushes to the `main` branch.

### 3. Clone Your Repository Locally
- Open Visual Studio Code (or your preferred code editor).
- Clone your forked repository to your local machine using Git and set up your development environment:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
  cd <your-repo-name>
  ```

### 4. Implement a Standard Branching Strategy
- Create a new feature branch (e.g., `feature/add-functionality`).

### 5. Develop a Comprehensive README
Include the following sections in your `README.md` file:
- **Project Title and Description**: Briefly describe the repository’s purpose.
- **Getting Started**: Provide setup instructions, including prerequisites and installation steps.
- **Usage Examples**: Add examples of how to use the repository, including code snippets.
- **Features**: Highlight key functionalities and features of the project.
- **Contributing**: Add contribution guidelines, including how to clone the repository, create branches, and submit pull requests.
- **License**: Specify the repository’s license, e.g., MIT License.

### 6. Make Meaningful Commits
- Ensure all commits have clear, descriptive messages.
- Example:
  ```plaintext
  Add: Initial project setup with README and LICENSE
  Update: Enhanced README with usage examples
  ```

### 7. Push Changes to Remote Repository
- Use the following Git commands to check the status, add changes, and push to the remote repository:
  ```bash
  git status
  git add .
  git commit -m "Descriptive message about the changes"
  git push origin <feature-branch-name>
  ```

### 8. Collaborate Using Pull Requests
- Create at least one issue in your repository with a task to complete.
- Then create at least one pull request (PR) to merge a feature branch into `main`.
- Use detailed PR descriptions to explain the changes made or new files added.
- Review the PR and, if satisfied, approve and merge it.

### 9. Submit Your Repository
- Share the repository URL with the instructor for review.
- Feedback will be provided via:
  - **GitHub Issues**: Suggestions for improvement.
  - **Pull Requests**: Example changes and code reviews.
- Address feedback and make updates accordingly.

---

## Deliverables
1. A GitHub repository URL shared with the instructor.
2. Demonstrated ability to respond to feedback via Issues and PRs.

---

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Naming Conventions**: Clarity and adherence to best practices.
- **README Quality**: Completeness and clarity of documentation.
- **Branching Strategy**: Effective use of branches for collaboration.
- **Commit Messages**: Descriptive and consistent.
- **PR Workflow**: Evidence of collaboration and meaningful discussions.
- **Feedback Integration**: Ability to address feedback constructively.
