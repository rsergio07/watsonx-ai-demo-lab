# Repository Challenge: Create and Submit Your Repository

## Objective
Apply the best practices for GitHub repositories by creating a well-structured and documented repository. Submit your repository URL for feedback and experience the process of receiving feedback via GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

---

## Task Requirements

### 1. Create a New Repository
- Use a clear and descriptive name that reflects the project’s purpose.
- Follow naming conventions (e.g., `sre-project-name` or `watsonx_model_trainer`).

### 2. Develop a Comprehensive README
Include the following sections in your `README.md` file:
- **Project Title and Description**: Briefly describe the repository’s purpose.
- **Getting Started**: Provide setup instructions.
- **Usage Examples**: Add examples of how to use the repository.
- **Features**: Highlight key functionalities.
- **Contributing**: Add contribution guidelines.
- **License**: Specify the repository’s license.

### 3. Implement a Standard Branching Strategy
- Create a `main` branch for production-ready code.
- Create at least two feature branches (e.g., `feature/add-functionality`, `feature/update-readme`).

### 4. Make Meaningful Commits
- Ensure all commits have clear, descriptive messages.
- Example:
  ```plaintext
  Add: Initial project setup with README and LICENSE
  Update: Enhanced README with usage examples
  ```

### 5. Protect the Main Branch
- Enable branch protection rules:
  - Require pull request reviews before merging.
  - Enforce status checks (if applicable).
  - Restrict direct pushes to the `main` branch.

### 6. Collaborate Using Pull Requests
- Create at least one pull request (PR) to merge a feature branch into `main`.
- Use detailed PR descriptions and follow review best practices.

### 7. Submit Your Repository
- Share the repository URL with the instructor for review.
- Feedback will be provided via:
  - **GitHub Issues**: Suggestions for improvement.
  - **Pull Requests**: Example changes and code reviews.
- Address feedback and make updates accordingly.

## Deliverables
1. A GitHub repository URL shared with the instructor.
2. Demonstrated ability to respond to feedback via Issues and PRs.

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Naming Conventions**: Clarity and adherence to best practices.
- **README Quality**: Completeness and clarity of documentation.
- **Branching Strategy**: Effective use of branches for collaboration.
- **Commit Messages**: Descriptive and consistent.
- **PR Workflow**: Evidence of collaboration and meaningful discussions.
- **Feedback Integration**: Ability to address feedback constructively.
