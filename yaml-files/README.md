This is an example of a YAML file for deploying Nginx on Kubernetes. The file defines a Deployment resource with three replicas of the Nginx container. The container runs the latest version of the Nginx image and exposes port 80. It also includes resource limits for CPU and memory, as well as liveness and readiness probes to ensure the container is healthy.

To add documentation to this code, you can use comments in the YAML file to explain the purpose and functionality of each section. For example:

          periodSeconds: 3
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: 80
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 3


// Assisted by watsonx Code Assistant yaml

nginx-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: nginx-service spec: selector: app: nginx ports: - protocol: TCP port: 80 targetPort: 80 type: LoadBalancer



This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Service named `nginx-service` that exposes port 80 of the `nginx` application. The service uses the `LoadBalancer` type, which means it will be exposed externally via a cloud load balancer.

The `selector` field specifies the labels that the `nginx` pods must have in order to be selected by the service. In this case, the `app` label must be set to `nginx`.

The `ports` field specifies the port that the service will expose internally and the port that the target pods will receive. In this case, port 80 of the service will forward to port 80 of the target pods.

Overall, this YAML file defines a basic Kubernetes Service that exposes the `nginx` application externally via a cloud load balancer.
