# Documentation

This is an example of a YAML file for deploying Nginx on Kubernetes. The file defines a Deployment resource with three replicas, a selector to match the app label, and a template for the pod spec. The pod spec includes a container named nginx, which uses the latest Nginx image, exposes port 80, sets CPU and memory limits, and defines liveness and readiness probes.

To add documentation to this code, you can use comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each section. For example:

## nginx-deployment.yaml

```yaml

  selector: # Selector to match pods
    matchLabels:

        - containerPort: 80 # Port to expose
        resources: # Resource limits for the container
          limits:
            cpu: "500m" # CPU limit
            memory: "1Gi" # Memory limit
        livenessProbe: # Liveness probe for the container
          httpGet: # HTTP GET request for the probe
            path: / # Path to probe
            port: 80 # Port to probe
          initialDelaySeconds: 5 # Initial delay for the probe
          periodSeconds: 5 # Period for the probe
        readinessProbe: # Readiness probe for the container
          httpGet: # HTTP GET request for the probe
            path: / # Path to probe
            port: 80 # Port to probe
          initialDelaySeconds: 5 # Initial delay for the probe
          periodSeconds: 5 # Period for the probe
```

This documentation provides information about the YAML file, the Kubernetes API version, the type of resource being defined, the name of the Deployment, the number of replicas, the selector to match pods, the pod metadata and labels, the container name, image, ports, resource limits, and liveness and readiness probes.

## nginx-service.yaml

This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Service named `nginx-service` that exposes port 80 of the `nginx` application. The service uses the `LoadBalancer` type, which means it will be exposed externally via a cloud load balancer.

The `selector` field specifies the labels that the `nginx` pods must have in order to be selected by the service. In this case, the `app` label must be set to `nginx`.

The `ports` field specifies the port that the service will expose internally and the port that the target pods will receive. In this case, port 80 of the service will forward to port 80 of the target pods.

Overall, this YAML file defines a basic Kubernetes Service that exposes the `nginx` application externally via a cloud load balancer.
